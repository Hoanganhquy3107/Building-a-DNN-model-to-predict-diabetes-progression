# Building-a-DNN-model-to-predict-diabetes-progression
â€¢ Description: Using the dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes to predict disease progression after 1 year.

â€¢ Technology: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib.

â€¢ Implementation steps:
o Data preprocessing: normalization, splitting training/testing sets.

o Building a DNN model with 2 hidden layers, batch normalization and dropout.

o Training the model with Nadam optimizer and early stopping.

o Evaluating the model with MSE, RMSE, MAE and RÂ².

o Saving the model (.h5) and predicting new data.

â€¢ Results: Accurately predicting disease progression, the model is improved with SELU and alpha dropout to increase stability and performance.

ðŸ§  Benchmark & tuning the AI system
â€¢ Compare performance before and after technical tuning (regularization, dropout).
â€¢ Use benchmarks to measure the model's accuracy, error, and generalization ability.
â€¢ From there, propose effective optimization strategies for real-world AI systems.
